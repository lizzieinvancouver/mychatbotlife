My life as a chatbot % I've been mistaken for a chatbot

Like many, I find writing a paper a painful process. Like some I am comforted by authors far better than me who stress it is a painful process in their writing books. I look for tips in their books to improve my writing and I work each paper through several outlines and usually many drafts.  

I asked a graduate student once about this process, and he remarked that the end result were reviews that almost always mentioned how well written the paper was. 

Imagine my surprised then when I received reviews back recently and found one reviewer declared it [quote] and the handling editor followed suit. 

Like all mature adults, I wanted to pick up my ball and march off the playground in a mad fury. So I was interested to see what others thought.

Ridiculous ... 

There was not much in these reviews about what to change, and there was nothing in them about what made the editor and reviewer so sure the paper was written by a chatbot other than [quote]

Why the accusation? Maybe they think fraud through writing is less of an accusation of fraud through fake data? 

Plodding with bursts, github commits

... ``For my part, I find it almost a defamatory accusation, as it undermines the intellectual honesty of the authors.\\
All scientific criticism is admissible, but this is a different matter.''

Distinguishing truth/reality from AI; people think they can, but they can't

My lab focuses on data transparency and data sharing.

Review process was flawed -- prejudiced, no due diligence

So much of science is built on trust and faith. We assume people did not fabricate data.

Scientific standards and ethics need to be strong to combat this; they're not naturally, and they never will be.

We're paranoid about AI taking over but it doesn't have to do anything than be out there to corrupt the system.
